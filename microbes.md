A quick overview of the complexity of the processes in a bio digester. The good news is that handling a small sized digester is not complex at all.


Groups of microbes:
- hydrolytic
- acidogenic
- acetogenic
- methanogenic
  - psychrophilic (as low as 17째C-20째C)
  - mesophilic (around 37째C)
  - thermophilic (around 57째C)
