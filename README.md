## Purpose of this digester
Small biodigesters like the one on the foto, made in juli 2018, can be used in the context of family farms to improve life quality in an ecological way. Apart from considerable ecological impact by generating a truly closed loop of resources it also has economical benefits in several ways while its construction is very simple. From the various types of installations that exist we chose the Plug-Flow type the one on the foto cost about 125 dollar in Cuba. Waste generated by humans and/or animals can be processed by this device to produce biogas and fertilizers. This particular type of digester is espcially suitable for tropical and high temperature areas because it works best with a tank liquid temperature of 37 C (99 F).
## How it works
> A biodigester is like a mechanical stomach. It is fed with organic material, which is broken down (decomposed) by micro-organisms (bacteria) in an oxygen-free (anaerobic) environment to produce renewable energy in the form of biogas while it also an exceptionally good fertilizer.
>Anaerobic digestion is a collection of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen.[1] The process is used for industrial or domestic purposes to manage waste or to produce fuels. Much of the fermentation used industrially to produce food and drink products, as well as home fermentation, uses anaerobic digestion.

## Use context
This biodegester can be used to process pig, cow, or other kind of biomatter. There are several important uses for this biodigester:
1. The most important is the use of natural organic fertilizer generated by the digester, for the farm. This organic fertilizer protects and enriches the soil, compared to industrial fertilizers and pesticides.
2. The biodigester produces from 1 to 2hr of biogas which can be used for cooking without the need of other type of energy (It can be also used to cook pig food).

## Design specifications
[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)
- Space, volume needed for the biodigester.
- Outlet installation reference to off the shelve components, like pipe joints, pipes, etc.
- Estimate size of pipe outlet dimension.
