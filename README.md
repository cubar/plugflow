## Purpose of this digester
Small biodigester like this one can be used in the context of family farms to improve life quality in an ecological way. It can also have tremendous ecological impact, by generating a truly closed loop of resources. Waste generated by humans and/or animals can be processed by this device to generate different products including biogas, and fertilizers. This particular type of digester are suitable for tropical and high temperature areas, due to the specific temperature that needs to be operated.
## How it works
> A biodigester is like a mechanical stomach. It is fed with organic material, which is broken down (decomposed) by micro-organisms (bacteria) is an oxygen-free (anaerobic) environment to produce a renewable energy called biogas (methane and carbon dioxide) and other material that is mainly used as fertilizer.([Retrieved "Remember the biodigester"](https://www.src.sk.ca/blog/remember-biodigester)).
>Anaerobic digestion is a collection of processes by which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen.[1] The process is used for industrial or domestic purposes to manage waste or to produce fuels. Much of the fermentation used industrially to produce food and drink products, as well as home fermentation, uses anaerobic digestion.[Find more in wkikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion)

## Use context
This biodegester can be used to process pig, cow, or other kind of biomatter. There are several important uses for this biodigester:
1. The most important is the use of natural organic fertilizer generated by the digester, for the farm. This organic fertilizer protects and enriches the soil, compared to industrial fertilizers and pesticides.
2. The biodigester produces from 1 to 2hr of biogas which can be used for cooking without the need of other type of energy (It can be also used to cook pig food).
3.  

## Design specifications
[//]: # (This may be the most platform independent comment)
- Space, volume needed for the biodigester.
- Outlet installation reference to off the shelve components, like pipe joints, pipes, etc.
- Estimate size of pipe outlet dimension.
